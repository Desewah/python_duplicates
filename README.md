# python_duplicates

compare -  checks two excel files and then returns a single file which has arrow indications to show d diff between d two excel files
I feel like the compare.py highlights the differences and returns a single file athough it uses arrows  to show the differences.

remove - this works for removing duplicates and returns a single file

remove duplicates and return 2 files: i'm lost

highlight duplicates and return 2 files: i also don't get d point


file_upload : i was working on uploading a file that will be compared since it is based on user input on files rii now i'm trying to figure out how to connect it in a way that python has access and can read d file, i used xampp as d local server to just check it out and it worked, so rii now i dont know if we can use sql to access it and parse it on to python

compare2: i've always had dis idea of using color coding so i decided to try it, if u notice d compare.py, d code shows the difference using arrows, i didn't feel like that was enough, so i wrote compare2.py to highlight the difference using color but i'm not still satisfied so i will try out using both arrow and color to indicate d diff, when i tried using ablebits, they show d difference using color coding and they also return d 2 files 
i think that's where the highlight duplicates and return 2 files come around

compare3: this is an additional feature for files that have different shapes in a case where this year in a car company they didn't buy highlander coz they didn't have an order for it but in the next year they bought highlander coz some guys ordered it hence there will be a diff in d shape, i'm not done with this,i got a different answer towhat was expected

I think we should schedule a google meet so that we can talk about all this stuffs and share our ideas
